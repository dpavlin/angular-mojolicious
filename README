REST JSONP server using mojolicious for <angular/>


<angular/>: Complex web apps made simple

This is my attempt to implement REST API described at:

http://docs.getangular.com/REST.Basic

using CouchDB HTTP view API

http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_view_API

to provide storage for experimenting with local datasets using angular.


At it's current stage it provides support for angular $resource get, query and $save

http://angularjs.org/Service:$resource


Replication of data between instances using angular REST API can be done with:

	# create local CouchDB database
	curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/test

	./angular-replicate.pl \
		http://dpavlin.getangular.com/data/conference \
		http://localhost:3000/data/test

Replication is currently good only for initial import of data since it doesn't
support incremental replication and dies if data is allready present.


Installation:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Optionally build angular to get single file download

	cd public/angular
	rake compile
	cd -

Start it with:

	./angular-server.pl daemon --reload  


Angular examples available:

- template/Cookbook - examples from wiki working against github version of angular
- template/conferece - conference submission example using mojolicious REST API server


Planned features:

- run queries against data using REST API (currently only simple get is supported)
