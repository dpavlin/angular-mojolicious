REST JSONP server using mojolicious for <angular/>


<angular/>: Complex web apps made simple
http://angularjs.org/


mojolicious: the web in the box!
http://mojolicious.org/


This is my attempt to implement REST API described at:

http://docs.getangular.com/REST.Basic

using simple in-memory model for experimenting with local datasets using
<angular/>


Installation:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Optionally build angular to get single file download

	cd public/angular
	rake compile
	cd -

Start it with:

	./angular-server.pl daemon --reload  


Angular examples available:

- template/Cookbook - examples from wiki working against github version of angular
- template/Work - conference submission example using mojolicious REST API server


Planned features:

- data persistence, probably to CouchDB (currently all data is stored in-memory)
- run queries against data using REST API (currently only simple get is supported)
